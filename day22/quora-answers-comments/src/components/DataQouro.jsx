        question: `There are many places around the world that are considered to be surreal or otherworldly. Some examples include:

The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia, which is the world's largest salt flat and creates a unique, white landscape.
The Zhangye Danxia Landform in China, which features colorful rock formations that look like they're from another planet.
The Cenotes in Mexico, which are natural sinkholes filled with crystal-clear water and surrounded by lush vegetation.
The Wisteria Tunnel in Japan, which is a tunnel-like pathway lined with wisteria flowers that bloom in vibrant shades of purple and pink.
The Antelope Canyon in Arizona, USA, which is a narrow slot canyon with striking light beams and undulating rock walls.
These are just a few examples, but there are many other places around the world that could be considered surreal. If you're interested in visiting any of these places, it's important to research the best time to visit, as well as any safety precautions or special requirements.`

        title: `What are some realistic ways to get rich in 5 years? I'm 25 now and want to hit around 200k USD by the age of 30. What are my options?`,
        question: `First things first.

No one was born with a silver spoon in his/her mouth. Everybody came with nothing into the world.

It's just that some people like to believe that if you were born in a rich family, you have a greater advantage, but the truth is that you don’t—especially in the digital age.

The rest of us who were born into poor or middle class families only have to work a little harder and a little smarter to catch up with our rich counterparts who were born into rich families.

However, all of us must be trained in extensive ways to create, manage, maintain, and grow wealth. Otherwise, our wealth will not last even one generation.

Mindset

Getting rich has little to do with the specific methods to implement and become rich, and more to do with a change of MINDSET.

In fact, getting rich comprises of 85% mindset, and 15% skills, methods and systems to create, manage, and maintain wealth.

There are practically thousands of methods you can implement online and offline to get rich, but if your mindset is wrong, it’s like water down the drain.`

        title: `Is there life after death?`,
        question: `There's an interesting post my friend shared on facebook :-

In a mother's womb were two babies. One asked the other:

"Do you believe in life after delivery?"
The other replies, "why, of course. There has to be something after
delivery. Maybe we are here to prepare ourselves for what we will be later.

"Nonsense," says the other. "There is no life after delivery. What would
that life be?"

"I don't know, but there will be more light than here. Maybe we will walk
with our legs and eat from our mouths."

The other says "This is absurd! Walking is impossible. And eat with our
mouths? Ridiculous. The umbilical cord supplies nutrition. Life after
delivery is to be excluded.

The umbilical cord is too short." "I think there is something and maybe it's
different than it is here."

the other replies, "No one has ever come back from there. Delivery is the
end of life, and in the after-delivery it is nothing but darkness and
anxiety and it takes us nowhere."

"Well, I don't know," says the other, "but certainly we will see mother and
she will take care of us."

"Mother??" You believe in mother? Where is she now?

"She is all around us. It is in her that we live. Without her there would
not be this world."

"I don't see her, so it's only logical that she doesn't exist."

To which the other replied, "sometimes when you're in silence you can hear
her, you can perceive her." I believe there is a reality after delivery and
we are here to prepare ourselves for that reality....`
