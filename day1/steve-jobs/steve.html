                <h3>Family</h3>
                <p>Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings.</p>
                
                <p>Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs was the son of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>

                <h3>Infancy</h3>
                In his youth, Jobs's parents took him to a Lutheran church. When Steve was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend, Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love Steve for the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him away from me."
                
                <blockquote>
                    "Of all the inventions of humans, the computer is going to rank near or at the top as history unfolds and we look back. It is the most awesome tool that we have ever invented. I feel incredibly lucky to be at exactly the right place in Silicon Valley, at exactly the right time, historically, where this invention has taken form."
                    —Steve Jobs, 1995.

                <p>Paul Jobs worked in several jobs that included a try as a machinist, several other jobs, and then "back to work as a machinist". Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and by 1959 the family had moved to the Monta Loma neighborhood in Mountain View, California. Paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to "pass along his love of mechanics".</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                    I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I liked electronics … then I read something that one of my heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I decided that's what I wanted to do.
                    —Steve Jobs
